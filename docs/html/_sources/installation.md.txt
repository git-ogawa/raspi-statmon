Installation
============

The program is single python script so that you just clone the repository in your local machine by `git clone`. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/git-ogawa/raspi-statmon.git
```
However, you need install the dependent packages. If you haven't installed the packages in requirements yet, can install them with pip
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/git-ogawa/raspi-statmon.git
```

The project uses MySQL, so install them with apt
```
sudo apt install mysql-server
```
you maybe can't install mysql in the version of your machine. In that case, try to install mariaDB instead.
```
sudo apt install mariadb-server-10.0
```
