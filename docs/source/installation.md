Installation
============

The program is single python script so that you just clone the repository in your local machine by `git clone`. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/git-ogawa/usbcamGUI.git
```
However, you need install the dependent packages. If you haven't installed the packages in requirements yet, can install them with pip
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/git-ogawa/usbcamGUI
```

The project uses MySQL, so install them with apt
```

```
